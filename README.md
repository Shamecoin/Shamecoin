## Hi there üëã

# Shamecoin

**Shamecoin** is a Solana-based token and dApp that transforms personal shame into gamified self-improvement. Individuals publicly confess their biggest challenges, gather community votes, and prove real progress on a live broadcast showdown‚Äîwhile an AI agent sniffs out deception. If they‚Äôre legit, they receive a reward of Shamecoin tokens; if not, the airdrop rolls over to the next round.

## Overview

- **Name**: Shamecoin (SHM)
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Concept**:
  1. **Shamegames**: Users post their ‚Äúshames‚Äù and vow to fix them.
  2. **Community Voting**: The crowd upvotes compelling posts.
  3. **Proof-of-Change**: Winners must prove genuine progress in a 1-month window.
  4. **Final Showdown**: A live broadcast Q&A against an AI lie-detector.
  5. **Airdrop or Rollover**: If the crowd is convinced, tokens are airdropped; otherwise, they roll over to the next round.

## Architecture

We split the project into three main components:

1. **Smart Contract (Solana Program)**:
   - Built with the [Anchor framework](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor).
   - Manages creation of shame posts, voting logic, proof submissions, and token airdrops.

2. **Frontend dApp**:
   - Developed in React (TypeScript) with [@solana/wallet-adapter](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter) for wallet connections.
   - Displays real-time data from the on-chain program, handles upvoting, and supports user proof submissions via IPFS/Arweave.

3. **AI Service** (optional advanced feature):
   - Python microservice using NLP or image classification to detect spam, hateful content, or possible fraud (in the live broadcast phase).
   - Could incorporate OpenAI or Hugging Face models for text and image moderation.

For a deeper look, see [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md).
